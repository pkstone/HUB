Herein lies the reconstructed source code for the original Hub (as in the computer music network band) networking devices,
which were two Synertek SYM-1 6502 single board computers with custom-wired ACIA serial ports. In June of 1987, two of these
devices were used for the first Hub concert, an event that took place over two nights simultaneously in two locations in lower
Manhattan. The two 'hubs' were connected by phone lines between the performance spaces...perhaps the first ever 'telematic'
live music performance.
