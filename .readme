This is the code from the original SYM-1 HUBs. The original source was lost, so this is disassembled from onboard ROM.

How this was done:

1) HUB ROM Memory was dumped in SYM HS Cassette Format, and recorded into an Audacity file, then exported to a 16-bit WAV file.

2) WAV file was scanned with 'DecodeWav.py', a Python program which counted the samples between zero crossings and converted
    these timings into ones and zeros, then assembled these into bytes.

3) The resulting 6502 machine code was disassembled and then decorated with labels and comments to show the workings of
    the program.

Also included: SYMCassetteSimulator.ino -- an Arduino program that uses the Arduino to simulate the output of a saved
    SYM program, thus making it possible to read files into the SYM via its cassette input port.
