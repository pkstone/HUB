This is the code from the original Synertek SYM-1 HUBs, used by the pioneer computer network music band The Hub.
The original source was lost, so this is disassembled from onboard ROM.

How this was done:

1) HUB ROM Memory was dumped in SYM HS Cassette Format, and recorded into Audacity, then exported to a 16-bit WAV file.

2) WAV file was scanned with 'DecodeWav.py', a Python program included here which counts the samples between zero crossings
    and converts these timings into ones and zeros, then assembles these into bytes of 6502 machine code.

3) The resulting 6502 machine code was disassembled and then decorated with labels and comments to show the workings of
    the program.

Also included: SYMCassetteSimulator.ino -- an Arduino program that uses the Arduino to simulate the output of a cassette
    dump from a SYM, thus making it possible to read files into the SYM via its cassette input port.
